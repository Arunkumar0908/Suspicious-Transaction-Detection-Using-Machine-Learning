# Suspicious Transaction Detection Using Machine Learning

This project utilizes machine learning models to detect suspicious transactions in a dataset, specifically for **anti-money laundering (AML)** purposes. We implement **One-Class SVM** and **Isolation Forest** models to identify anomalies in financial transactions. The goal of this project is to detect potentially suspicious transactions in real-time and flag them for further investigation.

## Project Overview

This project involves detecting suspicious transactions using a **synthetic dataset**. The key tasks include:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze the transaction data and identify patterns.
- **Model Selection & Training:** Use machine learning models like **One-Class SVM** and **Isolation Forest** to detect anomalies.
- **Deployment:** Create a **Streamlit web application** that predicts whether a transaction is suspicious based on user input.

The models are trained using features like the **Amount**, **Sender Account**, and **Receiver Account** to predict whether a transaction is **Suspicious** or **Normal**.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Synthetic Transaction Monitoring Dataset for AML** available on Kaggle. This dataset contains synthetic financial transaction data designed to mimic real-world transaction monitoring systems used for anti-money laundering (AML) purposes.

### How to Download the Dataset

Follow these steps to download the dataset:

1. **Install Kaggle API:**

   If you havenâ€™t installed the Kaggle API, install it by running:
   ```bash
   pip install kaggle
